Latest screenshots of ongoing work are maintained here: http://bit.ly/1coS12c Any design inputs are highly appreciated.

The project aims to provide open source XBMC remote control on the Windows Phone just like iOS and Android counterparts.
The project will make use of unique features of the Windows Phone platform and provide users with beautiful UI characteristic to the Windows Phone.
This client makes use of JSON-RPC (V6) API provided by XBMC and communicates over HTTP transport.
